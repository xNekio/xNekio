## About me

I'm the creator and developer behind **[Arefy Network](https://arefy.net)**, a Minecraft server network with multiple gamemodes, and **Nekio Setups**, a premium setup store with over 2,300 sales and a perfect rating on BuiltByBit.

I like building things from scratch. If I can make something custom instead of using a generic alternative, I will.

## 🔨 What I do

- **Java plugin development** for Paper API — economy systems, gamemode mechanics, PlaceholderAPI integrations and database management
- **Linux server administration** — OVH infrastructure, migrations, performance optimization
- **Database management** — MySQL, SQLite, migration scripts and internal tooling
- **Web development** — dashboards, network websites and management tools
- **Advanced configurations** — LuckPerms, WorldGuard, and a long list of plugins from the Minecraft ecosystem
